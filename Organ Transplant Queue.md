=================
For my customer analytics Github project I have decided to base my study on the Organ Transplantation Queue. In the rgan transplant queue the customer is the person waiting in line to get the organ while, the length of time they hve to spend in the queue is dependent on the number of people in the queue upon the persons arrival and the rate at which the server serves people in the queue. A simple queueing model to express this looks like this

## Organ Transplantation
Organ transplantation is one of the most common medical procedures carried out today. There are four types of transplantation that occur todat they are, 

Autograft: Transfer of tissue from an individual onto themselves (e.g skin graft)

Isograft: Transplantation of tissue from a genetically identical individual.

Xenograft: Transplant of organ tissue from one species to another.

Allograft: Transplant of organ tissue between two genetically non-identical members of the same species. Most common form of transplantation.  

These methods of transplantation allow the organs such as the the kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, pancreas, intestines and the eye (cornea). The kidneys and liver are two of the most commonly transported organs. They can be transplanted both from deceased and living donors. Living donation occurs when an individual offers to donate their organ to a person who is on the transplant list. Usually this an exchange between family members or people who know each other. Deceased donation occurs when an indivdual dies but still has fully functioning organs avaliable for transplantation. These organs are then offered up to the transplant pool where the next person in the queue will receive the avaiable organ.

## Organ Allocation
When constructing the organ transplant queue we must look at how organs are allocated to people. In 1977 the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) was formed with the intention of standardising the waiting list and finding the best match for donors and patients. Candidates fill out a transplantation register. The transplant registeration form asks you to give information which includes a patients blood-type, race, height, body mass index (BMI) and if the individual suffers from any current medical conditions (e.g. diabetic). 

Even though UNOS has done extensive work with regards streamlining the organ allocation procedure there are still some negative factors that effect the organ transplant list. The main problem the organ transplantation system faces is the trading of organs on the Black Market. In countries like China and India where there is a large divide between the rich and the poor we see alot of exploitation taking place. In China a person can pay $200,000 for an organ transplant and of that amount only $5,000 will go to the donor. In 2008 the Declaration of Istanbul was set up in an attempt to combat issues surrounding transplantation tourism, trafficing and exploitation.

## The Future of Organ Transplantation
Organ transplantation has seen great advances in the last number of years. There has been great advances in immunosuppressive drugs which allow for transfers organs to be accepted by their new host. It is hoped that it may be possible to have a set of personalised drugs for each person meaning that transplanted organs will never be rejected by their new host.
